FLIP is part of the AI Centre's approach to deploying AI at several NHS trusts. The platform will allow data from all consortium trusts to be stored in a standardised format. Therefore, a single query can be federated across the organisations without sharing patient data.

The standardised format used will be the OMOP Common Data Model. The purpose of the FLIP OMOP integration is twofold: Initially to run a cohort query to allow researchers to determine whether there is sufficient appropriate data across the cohort; and secondly, to provide access to specific data points during the training and testing phase of the algorithms.
