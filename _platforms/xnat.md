XNAT is a virtual platform capable of storing and managing medical images and associated data. Within Guy’s and St Thomas’ NHS Foundation Trust (GSTT), it forms a part of the local secure enclave for the purpose of federated learning in artificial intelligence projects. The data is ingested from PACS into XNAT where it is anonymised and sorted into relevant projects, ensuring data is only visible to those who need it, and allowing for data deletion upon project completion.
